## Description

Welcome to the User Management System repository! This open-source project is a Java-based application built using the Spring Boot framework. The User Management System allows users to manage application users through a set of APIs. With these APIs, users can perform various operations such as adding users, updating user information (including all properties), deleting users, retrieving users by their user ID, and retrieving a list of all users.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several parts, each serving a specific purpose:


### 1. Configuration

In this section, you'll find the configuration class for the database. Note that in this project, we're using a MySQL database, with user IDs as Primary keys and user.

### 2. Entities

This section contains the `User` class, which represents the core entity of the system. The `User` class includes the following properties:

- `userId` (Integer): Unique identifier for each user.
- `userName` (String): User's username.
- `address` (String): User's address.
- `phoneNumber` (String): User's phone number.
- `email` (String): user's email.
- `dateOfBirth` (string($date-time)) user's date of birth
- `date` (string($date-time)) time stamp date component when user is created
- `time` (string($date-time)) time stamp time component when user is created

### 3. Repository

In this section, you'll find the interface responsible for interacting with the database (MySQL) and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data.

### 4. Services

The Services section includes a set of service classes that the API Controller class uses to handle user management operations. The list of services includes:

- `addUser`: Adds a new user to the system.
- `getUser`: Retrieves user information by user ID.
- `getAllUser`: Retrieves a list of all users in the system.
- `updateUserInfo`: Updates user information, allowing for changes to name, username, address,email and phone number.
- `deleteUser`: Deletes a user by their user ID.

### 5. Controller

This section houses the `APIController` class, which provides API endpoints for interacting with the User Management System. Here is a list of available endpoints:

- `POST /user`: Adds a new user. Accepts a user object in the request body.
- `GET /user/{id}/id`: Retrieves user information by user ID.
- `GET /users`: Retrieves a list of all users.
- `PUT /update/id/info`: Updates user information. Accepts user ID and optional parameters for name, username, address, and phone number.
- `DELETE /user/{id}/id`: Deletes a user by user ID.

note: for further understanding you can use Swagger Ui at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html# if your running the app in localHost
## Data Flow
As soon as user hit any API the Controller handle it and Call the respective service, In Services section the buisness logic is applied and if the data base interaction required it hit the repository section. In repository section the data base interation take place.

## Database Scema
User{
userId*	Long
userName*	string
dateOfBirth	string($date-time)
email  String
address	string
phoneNumber*	string
date	string($date-time)
time	string($date-time)
}
